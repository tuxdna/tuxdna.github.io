Functions and Mappings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

* Domain: All possible input argument values
* Co-Domain: The domain in which the function's image would map
* Image: Output of the function applied to domain arguments
* Surjective: Image and co-doamain are equal
* Injective: Every element of the codomain is mapped to by at most one
element of the domain.
* Bijection, Injection, Surjection, Onto, one-to-one, argument, image,
domain, codomain:

Probabililty

Rules of Addition: A or B occuring together

* Exclusive events
+
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B)
* Non-exclusive events
+
P(A or B) = P(A) + P(B) - P(A and B)

Conditional Probability
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Probability of event E is called the _conditional probability_ of E
given that F has already occured and is denoted by `P(E|F)`:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------
P(E|F) = n(E n F) / n(F) = P(E n F) / P(F)

Here: (A n B) means ( A intersection B), and (A u B) means ( A union B)

Properties:

Property 1:
S = sample space; E and F are events in space S.

P(S|F) = P(F|F) = 1

Property 2:
A and B are events in space S. F is an event such tat P(F) = 0, then:

P( (A u B) | F) = P(A|F) + P(B|F) - P( (A n B) | F )

P( (A u B) | F) = P( (A u B) n F ) / P(F)
                = P( (A n F) u (B n F) ) / P(F)
                = ( P( P(A n F) + P(B n F) - P(A n B n F) ) / P(F)
                = P(A n F) / P(F) + P(B n F) / P(F) - P(A n B n F) / P(F)
                = P(A|F) + P(B|F) - P( A n B | F)

If A and B are disjoint events:

P( (A u B) | F) = P(A|F) + P(B|F)

Property 3:

P(E'|F) = 1 - P(E|F)

P(S|F) = 1 = P( (E u E') | F ) = P(E|F) + P(E'|F) => P(E'|F) = 1 - P(E|F)
