Information Retrieval

Read the paper on information retrieval by Xapian project: term
frequency, inverted document frequency

Corpus <-> IR System <-> Query : Relevant documents

Retrieval based on:

* Proper subject
* Recent documents
* Trusted documents
* Relevant

Text Processing:

* Stop word removal - the common words which don't contribute to
distinction among documents: a, an the, etc.
* Stemming: reducing the words to a common root or a stem

Indexing:

* constrct an inverted index - TF, IDF
* inverted index - word to document pointer

Searching:

Ranking:

Query Operations:

* Query expansion
* Quer transformation

Classes of retrieval models

* boolean ( set theoretic )
* vector space ( statistical / algebraic )
* probabilistic

Boolean Model:

* A document is represented as a "set of words"

Statistical Model:

* A document is represented as a "bag of words" with frequencies
attached.
* Bag = a set that allows multiple occurences of a word.

Vector-Space Model:

------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
 f = frequency of term in document = [0, T]
 tf = normalized term frequency = f / max(f in document) = [0,1]
 df = document frequency of term = number of documents that contain the term = [0,N]
 idf = inverse document frequency of term = log(N/df) : where N is total number of documents = [0,inf)
