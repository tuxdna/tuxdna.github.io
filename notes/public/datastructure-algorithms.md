# Algorithms

## Binary Search Tree:
 * Insert
 * Minimum and Maximum
 * Floor and ceiling
 * Selection - find the key k at rank r
 * Rank - find the rank r of key k
 * Delete Minimum and Delete Maximum
 * Delete

## 2-3 treee
 * 2 node - 1 key, 2 links
 * 3 node - 2 keys, 3 links
 * temporary 4 node  - 3 keys, 4 links
 * during insertion
   - 2 node case is simple i.e. convert it into a 3 node
   - 3 node get converted to a 4 node, of which middle key propagates to parent node, all the way up until it is 4 node is not formed. on reaching root node, the root node is split.

## Red Black tree

 * an extension of 2-3-4 tree represented in terms of a binary tree

## Sparse Matrix
