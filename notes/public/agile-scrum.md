# Agile Scrum

## Scrum Team Organization

### "pizza" team size (4 to 9 people)

### 15 minutes meeting daily

3 questions for each:
 - what have you done since yesterday?
 - what are you planning to do today?
 - are there any impediments and stumbling blocks?

## Scrum Roles: in a Team - 4 to 9 people

### Scrum Master:
A team member who acts as buffer between the Team and external distractions, keep team focussed on task at hand, enforces team rules, removes impediments that prevent team from making progress

### Product Owner:
A team member ( not the Scrum Master ) who represents the voice of the customer and prioritizes user stories.

## Summary

### Scrum Summary:
 - Basically, self-organizing small team with dialy short standup meetings
 - Work in "sprints" of 2-4 weeks
 - Suggest memeber rotate through roles ( especially Product Owner ) each iteration

### Measuring Productivity
 - A measure of team productivity: calculate avg number of stories per week
 - Some stories are much harder than others
 - Rate each user story in advance on a simple integer scale: 1 for straightforward stories, 2 for medium stories, 3 for very complex stories
 - Velocity: average number of points per week


### More on Points
 * Once you get experience, Fibonacci scale is commonly used: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8
  - Each new number is sum of previous 2
  - At Pivital Lab, 8 is extremely rare
 * Teams assign value: vote by holding up fingers simultaneously, take average
  - If a big disagreement (2 and 5), discuss more
 * `>= 5` means story should be broken up into simpler stories so that the backlog never has anything that is too demanding

## Pair Programming
* PP quicker when task complexity is low
* PP yields higher quality code when task complexity is high
 - anecdotally, sometimes more readable code too
* But more effort than solo programmers
* Also transfers knowledge between pair
 - programming idioms, tool tricks, company processes, latest technologies, ...
 - some teams purposely swap partners per task `=>` eventually everyone is paried


## Good Meetings: SAMOSAS
* __S__tart and stop meeting promptly
* __A__genda created in advance; no agenda; no meeting
* __M__inutes recorded so everyone can recall results
* __O__ne speaker at a time; no interrupting talker
* __S__end material in advance, since reading is faster
* __A__ction items at end of meeting, so know what each should do as a result of the meeting
* __S__et the date and time of next meeting

## Tools:
 - to take meeting notes: Round Robin order
 - be scrum master: Round Robin order
