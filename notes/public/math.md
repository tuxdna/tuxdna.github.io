## Functions and Mappings

 * Domain: All possible input argument values

 * Co-Domain: The domain in which the function's image would map

 * Image: Output of the function applied to domain arguments

 * Surjective: Image and co-doamain are equal

 * Injective: Every element of the codomain is mapped to by at most one element of the domain.

 * Bijection, Injection, Surjection, Onto, one-to-one, argument, image, domain, codomain: [Bijection, injection and surjection](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bijection,_injection_and_surjection) on Wikipedia
